## Work rules
```
The game of Nim starts with a random number of stones between 15 and 30. Two players alternate turns and on each turn may take either 1,2,or 3 stones from the pile. The players forced to take the last stone loses. Create a Nim application that allows the user to play against the computer. In this version of the game, the application generates the number of stones to begin with, the number of stones the computer takes, and the user goes first. The application code should:
Prevent the user from taking an illegal number of stones. For example, neither should be allowed to take three stones when there are only 1 or two left
Include an isValidEntry() method to check user input
Include a drawStones() method that generates a random number from 1 to 3 for the number of stones the computer draws.
Include a seperate method to handle the user’s turn and the computer’s turn. 

Application output should look similar to:

There are 22 stones. How many would you like to take? 3
There are 19 stones. The computer takes 2 stones.
There are 17 stones. How many would you like to take? …
